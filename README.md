Ruby script to scrape Instagram and dynamically like posts for a given tag through ARGV arguments. 

<hr>
 This is a quick ruby script to scrape instagram for certain tags and like them.
 You can set a maximum number of likes per tag and use an unlimited number of
 ARGV arguments to search for different tags. The next step would be to add a
 method to inport a csv for search terms or tags.
